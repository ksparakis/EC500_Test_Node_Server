node.js project submitted by Jeremy Konz U09617043 on Feb 13 2016

This project uses a single node instance to host a webpage (located at localhost:8081) to communicate to a server (localhost:8082) and emulates a simple user login. The webpage javascript sends the username and password in JSON format to the server. The server then compares the username and password and sends a response of success or failure. The expected username and password is user:qwerty123
